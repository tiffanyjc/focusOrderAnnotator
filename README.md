# Focus Order Annotation (Figma plugin)

Quickly annotate your designsâ€™ focus / tab order flow for keyboard-navigating users. Bulk add, remove, reorder, and update your annotations with a few button clicks. Adds all focus-order annotations into a single layer group that can be toggled on and off. 

## Getting Started

I'll post the plugin share key soon. :) 


### Installing

To get the TypeScript compiler working:

1. Download Visual Studio Code if you haven't already: https://code.visualstudio.com/.

2. Install the TypeScript compiler globally:

```
sudo npm install -g typescript
```

3. Open this directory in Visual Studio Code.

4. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: Run the "Terminal > Run Build Task..." menu item,
    then select "tsc: watch - tsconfig.json". You will have to do this again every time
    you reopen Visual Studio Code.

That's it! Visual Studio Code will regenerate the JavaScript file every time you save.
